# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. This project is meant to expose the most people to the underlying information contained within HackerRank answers. It is probably obvious but the originator of this repository is not a genius and cannot answer each question perfectly. The highest quality answers need to be presented to the community, answers that make it easy to understand how a problem is solved. Without further ado, let us get into how you can contribute.

1. If you see a problem/error, fork this repository, make your edit, then submit a pull request with your fix. Alternatively, you can create an issue with a well-written synopsis explaining what the problem is.
   
2. If you are submitting a pull request, or opening an issue, be sure to run your pull requests and issues through a spell checker and grammar checker to ensure they maintain a high level of readability and clarity for the community.
   
3. If you see any grammatical mistakes or spelling errors in problem solutions or documentation, submit a pull request with your edits.
   
4. Be kind, courteous, supportive, patient, understanding, respectful, and above all empathetic. It reflects poorly on your level of intelligence if you blast someone, who surely hasn't spent nearly as much time studying a solution as you, for making an *"easy"* error.

Welcome to the team of contributors that will hopefully find value in this repository being out there for the community to utilize.
